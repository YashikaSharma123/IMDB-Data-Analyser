The information IMDb comes from different sources such as filmmakers, film studios, and other official sources and analysing that data.

### Uses of Dataset
Our dataset can be accessed through this LINK.

The dataset has been used for some similar tasks analyzing movies. There are many data analysis about movies but some of them are outdated and not comprehensive. For example, many data analysis focusing on movies in a specific year or analysis specifically towards genre and movie types. Our dataset can also be used to analyze how people’s taste of movies change over the past few years or predict expected gross and budget by inserting other facts of that movie in the future. Our composition of the dataset might not impact future users and there aren’t any tasks that the dataset should be used.

### Our goal was to:
1. Use data-scraping technique to extract data from a IMDb movie list, and create a Dataset.

2. Use descriptive statistics and multi-regression modeling to visualize and analyze the data that we have collected.

### Conclusion
In this first part of our research, we used techniques such as data scraping and regular expression to create the database. In Part II, we will be analyzing the dataset that we have obtained from the movie list and conduct further statistical modeling and research.
